# REACT CALCULATOR

A calculator in React built using functional components.

# Project Specification

- A simple calculator built in React
- There should be an output that shows user inputs
- When equals is pressed the result should appear in the output and the requested steps should also be displayed
- Functionality is more important than looks
- Users shouldn't be able to add more than one period or operand

# To Do

- Currently this relies on eval which is insecure, replace this
- Styling could be added such as centering
- Currently after pressing equals then an operand it starts a new calculation, it would be nice if people could perform futher calculations on the results of previous calculatons
